#Switch to root user & create a docker file as shown below 

FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y sudo
USER jenkins


#By using this docker file create a docker image

docker build -t jenkins/jenkins:latest .


#Create a docker volume 

docker volume create jenkinsvolume




# create a docker container for jenkins image

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jekinscontainer -v jenkinsvolume:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:latest



docker run -d → correct (runs in detached mode).

-p 8080:8080 → correct (exposes Jenkins UI on your host at port 8080).

--name jekinscontainer → ✅ fine, though I notice a small typo (jekinscontainer instead of jenkinscontainer). It will still work, but maybe better to keep consistent naming.

-v jenkinsvolume:/var/jenkins_home → ✅ correct — maps your named volume (jenkinsvolume) to Jenkins home directory (where all jobs/configs/plugins are stored).

jenkins/jenkins:latest → ✅ valid image (though usually jenkins/jenkins:lts is recommended for stability in production).
